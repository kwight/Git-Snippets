=== Git Snippets ===

[TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/) is a useful tool for custom shortcuts on OS X. These shortcuts are called snippets, and can be imported by URL.

I've created a folder of snippets I use for Git commands (now over 60). To import these snippets for your own use:
1) In TextExpander, go to File > Add Group from URL...
2) Paste this URL: https://github.com/kwight/textexpander/raw/master/Git.textexpander
3) Click OK and enjoy!
